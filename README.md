# Smart-Inventory-Management-System-Using-QR-Code
## Problem Statement:
##### 1. Manual inventory tracking often leads to errors, inefficiencies, and difficulties with real-time stock tracking.
##### 2. Distributors and shop owners with multiple storage locations struggle to manage the movement of goods.
## Proposed Solution:
##### 1. A QR code-based digital solution to replace manual tracking, improving accuracy, speed, and convenience.
##### 2. System for distributors managing multiple storage facilities.
##### 3. Admin panel for CRUD operations on items.
##### 4. A unique QR code is generated for each new item placed on the shelf.
##### 5. Employees scan QR codes to view detailed item information (name, description, import/export history, profit metrics, and storage location).
